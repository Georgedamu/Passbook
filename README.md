### About the Name
PwdBook was originally called Passbook. After I realized many other apps also use this name, I decided to change it to PwdBook, another abbreviation form of "Password Book". For all releases before version 2.0, the name was Passbook.

### Notes

<a name="note1" id="md_anchor"><sup>1</sup>Material Themes</a>: Certain Material features require Android 4.4 or Android 5.0.

<a name="note2" id="md_anchor"><sup>2</sup>data synchronization</a>: Synchronization before version 2 uses Google Play Games snapshot service, which can save up to 3MB data. The integration with Google Drive is underdevelopment and it is to be available in version 2.0.
